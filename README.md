hid the environment variables
you will need to get a secret for spotify api, I had playlist id as a global in that environment
so make sure if you use this that you set it
it will give a runtime error if its not defined so you will see the issue either way

---
the spotify api code generated a text file that will be used in downloader.py, so you wouldnt run downloader.py first
